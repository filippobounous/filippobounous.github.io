This repository hosts my personal GitHub Pages site. It currently displays a list of my projects in CSV form and includes contact links. The landing page shows placeholders for my current title, company, and academic experience.

The page also links to my CV. It notes when the file was last updated, but you can contact me for a more recent copy.

Feel free to open issues or pull requests if you spot something wrong!
