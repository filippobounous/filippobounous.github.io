This repository hosts my personal GitHub Pages site. It lists projects from my GitHub account and includes contact links. The landing page now pulls my job title from LinkedIn on page load (with a static fallback) and links to my experience on LinkedIn.

The projects section is populated dynamically by querying the GitHub API for my starred repositories.

Rather than hosting a copy of my CV here, the page invites visitors to get in touch if they'd like a copy.

Highlighted projects include a personal finance toolkit called **fbinv**, several data analysis exercises from FreeCodeCamp, and the code for this very website.

Feel free to open issues or pull requests if you spot something wrong!
Connectivity to the internet was verified by reaching the GitHub API.
